# MOTOTRBO Zone Generator - Streamlit Frontend

This is a web-based frontend for the MOTOTRBO zone file generator that uses the BrandMeister API to retrieve DMR repeater information and generate zone files for Motorola DMR radios.

## Installation
If you want to host your own copy of the webapp you can leverage the userdata file to bootstrap a linux machine (I host on AWS using Amazon Linux 2023). In general the install is:
1. Ensure you have Python installed

2. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements_streamlit.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. The app will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501
